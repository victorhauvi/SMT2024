SMT Data Challenge for Jason, Kishan, Matt, Victor

Let's all use git properly this time:

To get started:
Git clone this repo 1 time
```
git clone <link to this repo>
```

Once the repository is cloned, navigate into the repository directory and make a branch (do this 1 time). 
```
git checkout -b <new_branch_name>
```

Make your changes, do your work, then stage them (make sure you are in the same repository as your branch):
```
git add <specific filename>
```
OR to stage all your files 
```
git add .
```

Then commit your changes:
```
git commit -m "type some message of what your changes are about"
```

If you are already in the directory that you are going to push:
```
git push
```
```
git push origin
```
```
git push origin <new_branch_name>
```
One of these will work idk which
