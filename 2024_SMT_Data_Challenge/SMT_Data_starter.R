# Welcome to the 2024 SMT Data Challenge! Here are some functions to help you get
# started. After you unzip the dataset, copy the name of the directory you saved 
# it to into the 'data_directory` field below. After making sure you have the 
# `arrow` package installed, you may call this file at the top of your work file(s)
# by calling `source("SMT_Data_starter.R"). Then, you may apply functions and 
# operations to the table names below as you would any other table and load them 
# into your working environment by calling `collect()`. For an example of this 
# process, un-comment and run the lines below the starter code. 
# 
# WARNING: The data subsets are large, especially `player_pos`. Reading the 
#   entire subset at once without filtering may incur performance issues on your 
#   machine or even crash your R session. It is recommended that you filter 
#   data subsets wisely before calling `collect()`.
