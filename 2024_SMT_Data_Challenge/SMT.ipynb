    "I left the read-in csvs in their season separated format. So first concatenate the game_info seasonal dataframes into one general one. Then convert the NaNs to 0, and the float values to integer value for the position information. One thing is the game_info CSVs are missing quite a bit of information about the batters, which cuts into the available plays we want to analyze, since we don't know who is playing during those plays. We are going to assume that players will not switch out midgame, i.e if an outfielder is playing at the top of the 1st inning, its safe to assume they will be an outfielder for the whole game. As such, if we have at least one row for a game string where the players are defined at the top of the inning, we can fill out the rest of the inning."

We want to use 5 as a marker for the end of a play, so we identify if a 2 event and 5 event happen at the same timestamp, the 5 event should always come after.

However, game_events and game_info have play_per_position. Game_events has both, but game_info only has play_per_game, so during pickoff plays, the alignment between play_per_game and play_id gets messed up"
